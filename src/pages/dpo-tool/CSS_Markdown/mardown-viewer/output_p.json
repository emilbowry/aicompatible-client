In some cases, the words most likely to appear next may not be the most factually accurate. For this reason, you should not rely on the factual accuracy of output from our models. If you notice that ChatGPT output contains factually inaccurate information about you and you would like to request a correction or removal of the information, you can submit these requests through privacy.openai.com or to [dsar@openai.com\u2060](mailto:dsar@openai.com), and we will consider your request based on applicable law and the technical capabilities of our models.\n\nFor information on how to exercise your rights with respect to data we have collected from the internet to train our models, please see this [notice\u2060(opens in a new window)](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7842364-how-chatgpt-and-our-language-models-are-developed).\n\n## 7.

We may also disclose personal data to third parties in connection with claims, disputes or litigation, when otherwise permitted or required by law, or if we determine its disclosure is necessary to protect the health and safety of you or any other person, to protect against fraud or credit risk, to enforce our legal rights or the legal rights of others, to enforce contractual commitments that you have made, or as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law.\n* **With an individual's consent.**\u00a0Anthropic will otherwise disclose personal data when an individual gives us permission or directs us to disclose this information, including as a part of our Services.\n\nYou can find information on our\u00a0[Subprocessor List](https://www.anthropic.com/subprocessors)\u00a0about the third parties Anthropic engages to help us process personal data provided to us where Anthropic acts as a data processor, such as with respect to personal data we receive, process, store, or host when you use Anthropic's commercial services.\n\n## 4. Rights and Choices\n\nDepending on where you live and the laws that apply in your country of residence, you may enjoy certain rights regarding your personal data, as described further below. However, please be aware that these rights are limited, and that the process by which we may need to action your requests regarding our training dataset are complex. We may also decline a request if we have a lawful reason for doing so. That said, we strive to prioritize the protection of personal data, and comply with all applicable privacy laws.\n\nTo exercise your rights, you or an authorized agent may submit a request by emailing us at\u00a0[privacy@anthropic.com](mailto:privacy@anthropic.com). After we receive your request, we may verify it by requesting information sufficient to confirm your identity. You may also have the right to appeal requests that we deny by emailing\u00a0[privacy@anthropic.com](mailto:privacy@anthropic.com). Anthropic will not discriminate based on the exercising of privacy rights you may have. Set out below is a summary of the rights which you may enjoy, depending on the laws that apply in your country of residence.\n\n* **Right to know:**\u00a0the right to know what personal data Anthropic processes about you, including the categories of personal data, the categories of sources from which it is collected, the business or commercial purposes for collection, and the categories of third parties to whom we disclose it.\n* **Access & data portability:** the right to request a copy of the personal data Anthropic processes about you, subject to certain exceptions and conditions. In certain cases and subject to applicable law, you have the right to port your information.\n* **Deletion:**the right to request that we delete personal data collected from you when you use our Services, subject to certain exceptions. You also are able to\u00a0[delete individual conversations](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/8230524-how-can-i-delete-or-rename-a-conversation), which will be removed immediately from your conversation history and automatically deleted from our back-end within 30 days. Learn more\u00a0[here](https://privacy.anthropic.com/en/articles/10023548-how-long-do-you-store-personal-data).\n* **Correction:**the right to request that we correct inaccurate personal data Anthropic retains about you, subject to certain exceptions. Please note that we cannot guarantee the factual accuracy of Outputs. If Outputs contain factually inaccurate personal data relating to you, you can submit a correction request and we will make a reasonable effort to correct this information\u2014but due to the technical complexity of our large language models, it may not always be possible for us to do so.\n* **Objection:** the right to object to processing of your personal data, including profiling conducted on grounds of public or legitimate interest. In places where such a right applies, we will no longer process the personal data in case of such objection unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. If we use your information for direct marketing, you can object and opt out of future direct marketing messages using the unsubscribe link in such communications.\n* **Restriction:** the right to restrict our processing of your personal data in certain circumstances.\n* **Withdrawal of consent.**\u00a0Where Anthropic\u2019s processing of your personal data is based on consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent. The withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.\n* **Automated decision-making**: Anthropic does not engage in decision making based solely on automated processing or profiling in a manner which produces a legal effect (i.e., impacts your legal rights) or significantly affects you in a similar way (e.g., significantly affects your financial circumstances or ability to access essential goods or services).\n* **Sale & targeted Anthropic marketing of its products and services**. Anthropic does not \u201csell\u201d your personal data as that term is defined by applicable laws and regulations. You can opt-out of sharing your personal data for targeted advertising to promote our products and services, and we will honor global privacy controls. To learn more,\u00a0[click here](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/cookies).\n\nAnthropic gives you access to a variety of tools to help you manage your data. You can access these in your [Privacy Settings](https://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.6c120961-d2ba-4d73-86ac-5bb1dbf534ce/settings/privacy).\n\n## 5. Data Transfers\n\nWhen you access our website or Services, your personal data may be transferred to our servers in the US, or to other countries outside the European Economic Area (**\u201cEEA\u201d**) and the UK. This may be a direct provision of your personal data to us, or a transfer that we or a third party make.\n\nWhere information is transferred outside the EEA or the UK, we ensure it benefits from an adequate level of data protection by relying on:\n\n* **Adequacy decisions.**These are decisions from the European Commission under Article 45 GDPR (or equivalent decisions under other laws) where they recognise that a country outside of the EEA offers an adequate level of data protection. We transfer your information as described in \u201cCollection of Personal Data\u201d to some countries with adequacy decisions, such as the countries listed\u00a0[here](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en); or\n* **Standard contractual clauses.**The European Commission has approved contractual clauses under Article 46 GDPR that allows companies in the EEA to transfer data outside the EEA. These (and their approved equivalent for the UK and Switzerland) are called standard contractual clauses. We rely on standard contractual clauses to transfer information as described in \u201cCollection of Personal Data\u201d to certain affiliates and third parties in countries without an adequacy decision.\n\nIn certain situations, we rely on derogations provided for under applicable data protection law to transfer information to a third country.\n\n## 6. Data Retention, Data Lifecycle, and Security Controls\n\nAnthropic retains your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes and criteria outlined in this Privacy Policy and explained further in our\u00a0[privacy center](https://privacy.anthropic.com/en/articles/10023548-how-long-do-you-store-personal-data).\n\nWhen the personal data collected is no longer required by us, we and our service providers will perform the necessary procedures for destroying, deleting, erasing, or converting it into an anonymous form as permitted or required under applicable laws.\n\n### Aggregated or De-Identified Information\n\nWe may process personal data in an aggregated or de-identified form to analyze the effectiveness of our Services, conduct research, study user behavior, and train our AI models as permitted under applicable laws. For instance:\n\n* When you submit Feedback, we disassociate Inputs and Outputs from your user ID to use them for training and improving our models.\n* If our systems flag Inputs or Outputs for potentially violating our\u00a0[Usage Policy](https://anthropic.com/legal/aup), we disassociate the content from your user ID to train our trust and safety internal classification and generative models. However, we may re-identify the Inputs or Outputs to enforce our Usage Policy with the responsible user if necessary.\n* To improve user experience, we may analyze and aggregate general user behavior and usage data. This information does not identify individual users.\n\n### Security Controls Relating to our Processing of Personal Data\n\nWe implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect personal data from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.\n\n## 7. Children\n\nOur Services are not directed towards, and we do not knowingly collect, use, disclose, sell, or share any information from children under the age of 18. If you become aware that a child under the age of 18 has provided any personal data to us while using our Services, please email us at\u00a0[privacy@anthropic.com](mailto:privacy@anthropic.com)\u00a0and we will investigate the matter and, if appropriate, delete the personal data.\n\n## 8.

Supplemental Disclosures for Residents of Brazil\n\nThese supplemental disclosures contain additional information relevant to residents of Brazil. This content should be read in conjunction with the rest of our Privacy Policy. In case of conflict between our Privacy Policy and these supplemental disclosures, the supplemental disclosures shall prevail in relation to residents of Brazil.\n\nLegal Bases.\u00a0Depending on the specific purpose of the processing, we may rely on different grounds than those listed under section 2, where permitted by and in accordance with the Brazilian General Data Protection Law (LGPD).
